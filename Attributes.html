    <p><pre>HTML has different kinds of attributes
        Basing on the type of tags we have different types of attributes,
        like for links we use the attributen "href"
        as <a href="www.https://www.google.com/">GOOGLE</a>
        like this for images also we have attribute like
        <img src="" alt="car" height="150" width="120"> CAR</img>
        And we can also style our paragraph or any other tags using style tag attributes like
        <h3 style="color:blue"> I'am a H3 tag with blue colour</h3>
        n then we do also have attributes for the "language" and "country code" and for title also
    </pre></p>
